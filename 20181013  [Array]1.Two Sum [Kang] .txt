1. Two Sum

Description:
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

Hints:
if target - nums[i] in hash:

Code:
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        hash ={}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if target - nums[i] in hash:
                return [hash[target-nums[i]],i]
            hash[nums[i]] = i
        return [-1,1]
